Quickstart Example
------------------

See a 40%+ performance improvement in just 3 lines of code with the quickstart example.


Business Value Example
----------------------

Learn how to optimize for dollars rather than statistical metrics with cost-sensitive optimization.

Multiclass Example
------------------

Handle complex multi-class scenarios with advanced threshold strategies.

Interactive Demo
----------------

Deep dive into the mathematical foundations with an interactive exploration.

Running the Examples
--------------------

To run these examples locally:

1. **Install with examples dependencies**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install optimal-classification-cutoffs[examples]

2. **Download the notebooks** from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/finite-sample/optimal-classification-cutoffs/tree/master/docs/examples>`_

3. **Launch Jupyter**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      jupyter notebook

4. **Open and run** any of the example notebooks

Key Learning Path
-----------------

For the best learning experience, follow this order:

1. **01_quickstart.ipynb** - See immediate improvements with minimal code
2. **02_business_value.ipynb** - Understand cost-sensitive optimization  
3. **03_multiclass.ipynb** - Master advanced multiclass strategies
4. **04_interactive_demo.ipynb** - Deep dive into mathematical foundations

Each example builds on the previous ones while being self-contained enough to run independently.
