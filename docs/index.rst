Optimal Classification Cutoffs
===============================

Optimize classification thresholds to improve model performance. The library provides efficient algorithms for threshold selection in binary and multiclass classification.

**Why Default 0.5 Thresholds Are Wrong:**

Most classifiers output probabilities, but decisions need thresholds. The default τ = 0.5 assumes equal costs and balanced classes. Real problems have imbalanced data (fraud: 1%, disease: 5%) and asymmetric costs (missing fraud costs $1000, false alarm costs $1).

Why Optimize Classification Thresholds?
=======================================

Most classifiers use a default threshold of 0.5, but this is often suboptimal for:

🏥 **Medical Diagnosis**
   False negatives (missed diseases) cost far more than false positives

🏦 **Fraud Detection**
   Missing fraud has higher cost than investigating legitimate transactions

📧 **Spam Detection**
   Blocking legitimate emails is worse than letting some spam through

📊 **Imbalanced Datasets**
   Default thresholds perform poorly when classes have very different frequencies

The Problem with Standard Optimization
======================================

Classification metrics like F1 score are **piecewise-constant functions** that create challenges for traditional optimization methods:

.. image:: piecewise_f1_demo.png
   :alt: F1 Score Piecewise Behavior
   :width: 600px
   :align: center

Standard optimizers fail because these functions have:

* **Zero gradients** everywhere except at breakpoints
* **Flat regions** providing no directional information
* **Step discontinuities** that trap optimizers

Our solution uses specialized algorithms designed for piecewise-constant optimization.

Quick Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

   from optimal_cutoffs import optimize_thresholds
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

   # Generate imbalanced dataset
   X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, weights=[0.9, 0.1], random_state=42)
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)

   # Train classifier
   clf = RandomForestClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_prob = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

   # Find optimal threshold (automatic algorithm selection)
   result = optimize_thresholds(y_test, y_prob, metric='f1')
   threshold = result.thresholds[0]
   print(f"Optimal F1 threshold: {threshold:.3f}")

   # Compare with default 0.5 threshold
   default_pred = (y_prob >= 0.5).astype(int)
   optimal_pred = (y_prob >= threshold).astype(int)

   from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
   print(f"Default F1: {f1_score(y_test, default_pred):.3f}")
   print(f"Optimal F1: {f1_score(y_test, optimal_pred):.3f}")

Algorithm Performance
=====================

The library provides multiple optimization algorithms with different trade-offs:

**Available Methods:**

* **sort_scan**: O(n log n) exact algorithm for piecewise metrics - fastest for large datasets
* **minimize**: Uses scipy optimization with fallback to ensure global optimum
* **gradient**: Simple gradient ascent (baseline method)
* **auto** (default): Automatically selects the best method based on data characteristics

**Performance Characteristics:**

* The ``sort_scan`` method scales as O(n log n) where n is the number of samples
* For piecewise metrics (F1, accuracy, precision, recall), ``sort_scan`` guarantees the global optimum
* The ``auto`` method intelligently selects between algorithms based on metric properties
* All methods are tested to complete within reasonable time limits (see ``tests/performance/``)
