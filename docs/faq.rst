Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

General Questions
-----------------

**Q: When should I use this library instead of the default 0.5 threshold?**

A: You should consider optimizing thresholds when:

- Your dataset is imbalanced (one class much more frequent than others)
- Different types of errors have different costs (e.g., medical diagnosis, fraud detection)
- You need to maximize a specific metric (F1, precision, recall) rather than general accuracy
- Your model probabilities are well-calibrated but the default threshold performs poorly

**Q: How does this differ from adjusting class weights in the classifier?**

A: Class weights affect the model's learning process during training, while threshold optimization is a post-training technique. They serve different purposes:

- **Class weights**: Change how the model learns from imbalanced data
- **Threshold optimization**: Find the best decision boundary after training

You can (and often should) use both techniques together.

**Q: Can I use this with any type of classifier?**

A: Yes, as long as your classifier outputs probabilities or scores. The library works with:

- Scikit-learn classifiers (``predict_proba()``)
- XGBoost, LightGBM (``predict_proba()`` or raw scores)
- Neural networks (softmax outputs)
- Any model that provides calibrated probability estimates

**Q: What's the difference between binary and multiclass optimization?**

A: 

- **Binary**: Finds a single optimal threshold for the positive class
- **Multiclass**: Finds per-class thresholds using One-vs-Rest strategy, then applies sophisticated decision rules for final predictions

Multiclass is automatically detected when you provide a 2D probability matrix.

Technical Questions
-------------------

**Q: Which optimization method should I use?**

A: Use ``method='auto'`` (default) for most cases. It automatically selects the best algorithm:

- **sort_scan**: O(n log n) exact algorithm for piecewise metrics (F1, accuracy, precision, recall)
- **smart_brute**: Evaluates all unique probability values, guaranteed exact result  
- **minimize**: Uses scipy optimization with enhanced fallbacks

For specific needs:
- **Large datasets**: ``method='sort_scan'`` 
- **Highest precision**: ``method='smart_brute'``
- **Non-piecewise metrics**: ``method='minimize'``

**Q: What does "piecewise-constant" mean?**

A: Piecewise-constant functions only change values at specific points (breakpoints). For classification metrics:

- F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall only change when the threshold crosses a unique probability value
- Between these points, the metric value stays constant
- This creates "flat regions" that can trap gradient-based optimizers

**Q: How do I handle tied probabilities?**

A: Use the ``comparison`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

   # Exclusive: prediction = 1 if prob > threshold
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y, prob, comparison='>')
   
   # Inclusive: prediction = 1 if prob >= threshold  
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y, prob, comparison='>=')

The choice affects how samples with probabilities exactly equal to the threshold are classified.

**Q: Why are my multiclass results different from argmax predictions?**

A: The library uses threshold-based decision rules that can differ from simple argmax:

1. **Apply per-class thresholds** to get binary predictions for each class
2. **Multiple classes above threshold**: Predict the one with highest probability
3. **No classes above threshold**: Predict the class with highest probability

This can sometimes select a class with lower absolute probability but higher margin (probability - threshold).

Data and Performance Questions
------------------------------

**Q: Do I need calibrated probabilities?**

A: For best results, yes. Well-calibrated probabilities ensure that the threshold has meaningful interpretation:

.. code-block:: python

   from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV
   
   # Apply calibration before threshold optimization
   calibrated_clf = CalibratedClassifierCV(base_classifier, method='isotonic')
   calibrated_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
   
   y_prob = calibrated_clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y_train, y_prob_train, metric='f1')

**Q: How much data do I need for reliable threshold optimization?**

A: General guidelines:

- **Minimum**: ~100 samples per class for basic optimization
- **Recommended**: ~1000 samples per class for stable results  
- **Cross-validation**: Use CV with smaller datasets to get robust estimates

For very small datasets, consider using cross-validation or bootstrap methods.

**Q: Can I use sample weights?**

A: Yes, all optimization methods support sample weights:

.. code-block:: python

   from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_sample_weight
   
   # Automatic balancing
   weights = compute_sample_weight('balanced', y_train)
   
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(
       y_train, y_prob, metric='f1', 
       sample_weight=weights
   )

**Q: How do I handle concept drift in production?**

A: Monitor threshold performance and retrain when needed:

.. code-block:: python

   # Regularly check if optimal threshold has drifted
   current_optimal = get_optimal_threshold(y_recent, y_prob_recent, metric='f1')
   
   if abs(current_optimal - production_threshold) > 0.05:
       print("Threshold drift detected - consider retraining")

See the :doc:`advanced` section for complete monitoring examples.

Cost-Sensitive Questions
-------------------------

**Q: How do I set up cost-sensitive optimization?**

A: Define utilities for each outcome type:

.. code-block:: python

   # Example: Medical diagnosis
   medical_utilities = {
       "tp": 1000,    # Benefit: Early detection saves $1000
       "tn": 0,       # No additional cost for correct negative  
       "fp": -200,    # Cost: Unnecessary procedure costs $200
       "fn": -5000    # Cost: Missed diagnosis costs $5000
   }
   
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(
       y_true, y_prob, 
       utility=medical_utilities
   )

**Q: What's the difference between empirical and Bayes-optimal thresholds?**

A: 

- **Empirical**: Optimizes threshold based on your training data (accounts for model miscalibration)
- **Bayes-optimal**: Theoretical optimum for perfectly calibrated probabilities (no training data needed)

.. code-block:: python

   # Empirical (default)
   threshold_emp = get_optimal_threshold(y_true, y_prob, utility=costs)
   
   # Bayes-optimal  
   threshold_bayes = get_optimal_threshold(None, y_prob, utility=costs, bayes=True)

Use empirical for real models; use Bayes-optimal for theoretical analysis or when you trust calibration.

**Q: Can I optimize for different costs per class in multiclass problems?**

A: Not directly in the current version, but you can optimize each class separately:

.. code-block:: python

   def multiclass_different_costs(y_true, y_prob, class_costs):
       n_classes = y_prob.shape[1]
       thresholds = []
       
       for class_idx in range(n_classes):
           # Convert to binary problem
           y_binary = (y_true == class_idx).astype(int)
           y_prob_binary = y_prob[:, class_idx]
           
           # Use class-specific costs
           costs = class_costs[class_idx]
           
           threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y_binary, y_prob_binary, utility=costs)
           thresholds.append(threshold)
       
       return np.array(thresholds)

This feature is planned for future releases.

Error Messages and Troubleshooting
----------------------------------

**Q: I'm getting "No vectorized implementation available" - what does this mean?**

A: You're trying to use ``method='sort_scan'`` with a metric that doesn't have a vectorized implementation:

.. code-block:: python

   # This will fail if 'custom_metric' lacks vectorized version
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y, prob, metric='custom_metric', method='sort_scan')
   
   # Solutions:
   # 1. Use different method
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y, prob, metric='custom_metric', method='smart_brute')
   
   # 2. Register vectorized version of your metric
   from optimal_cutoffs.metrics import register_metric
   register_metric('custom_metric', custom_func, vectorized_func=custom_vectorized)

**Q: Why am I getting "Labels must be consecutive integers starting from 0"?**

A: Multiclass optimization requires class labels to be ``[0, 1, 2, ..., n_classes-1]``:

.. code-block:: python

   # Bad: labels are [1, 2, 3, 4]
   y_bad = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2])
   
   # Good: labels are [0, 1, 2, 3]  
   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
   le = LabelEncoder()
   y_good = le.fit_transform(y_bad)
   
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y_good, y_prob, metric='f1')

**Q: The optimization is very slow - how can I speed it up?**

A: Several strategies:

.. code-block:: python

   # 1. Use faster method for large datasets
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y, prob, metric='f1', method='sort_scan')
   
   # 2. Reduce data size with sampling
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   y_sample, _, prob_sample, _ = train_test_split(y, prob, test_size=0.7, stratify=y)
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y_sample, prob_sample, metric='f1')
   
   # 3. Use simpler comparison operator
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y, prob, metric='f1', comparison='>')  # Slightly faster than '>='

**Q: My cross-validation results have high variance - is this normal?**

A: Some variance is expected, but high variance suggests:

.. code-block:: python

   from optimal_cutoffs import cv_threshold_optimization
   
   # Check CV results
   thresholds, scores = cv_threshold_optimization(y, prob, metric='f1', cv=10)
   
   print(f"Threshold std: {np.std(thresholds):.3f}")
   print(f"Score std: {np.std(scores):.3f}")
   
   # High variance solutions:
   # 1. Increase data size
   # 2. Use more folds: cv=10 or cv=20
   # 3. Use stratified CV for imbalanced data
   # 4. Consider ensemble methods

Integration Questions
--------------------

**Q: How do I integrate this with scikit-learn pipelines?**

A: Use the ``ThresholdOptimizer`` class:

.. code-block:: python

   from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
   from optimal_cutoffs import ThresholdOptimizer
   
   # Note: This requires custom pipeline components to extract probabilities
   # See examples for full implementation
   
   # Simpler approach: Apply threshold optimization after pipeline
   pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('clf', LogisticRegression())])
   pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
   
   y_prob = pipeline.predict_proba(X_train)[:, 1]
   optimizer = ThresholdOptimizer(metric='f1')
   optimizer.fit(y_train, y_prob)
   
   # For predictions
   y_prob_test = pipeline.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  
   y_pred = optimizer.predict(y_prob_test)

**Q: Can I save and load optimized thresholds?**

A: Yes, use pickle or joblib:

.. code-block:: python

   import joblib
   from optimal_cutoffs import ThresholdOptimizer
   
   # Save
   optimizer = ThresholdOptimizer(metric='f1')
   optimizer.fit(y_train, y_prob_train)
   joblib.dump(optimizer, 'threshold_optimizer.pkl')
   
   # Load
   loaded_optimizer = joblib.load('threshold_optimizer.pkl')
   y_pred = loaded_optimizer.predict(y_prob_test)

**Q: How do I use this with deep learning frameworks?**

A: Extract probabilities from your model and apply threshold optimization:

.. code-block:: python

   # PyTorch example
   import torch
   
   model.eval()
   with torch.no_grad():
       outputs = model(X_test_tensor)
       y_prob = torch.softmax(outputs, dim=1).cpu().numpy()
   
   # For binary classification, use column 1
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y_test, y_prob[:, 1], metric='f1')
   
   # TensorFlow/Keras example  
   y_prob = model.predict(X_test)
   threshold = get_optimal_threshold(y_test, y_prob, metric='f1')
